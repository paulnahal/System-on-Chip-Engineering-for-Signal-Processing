*** ELEC 466/568 Project Report Guidelines ***

Your project report should include:
1. Problem description and solution outline.
2. SW-HW handshaking protocol timing diagram.
3. State diagram of the handshaking protocol for HW.
4. Flow chart of the handshaking protocol for SW.
5. Block diagram of the HW multiplier datapath.
6. State diagram of the HW multiplier controller.
7. SystemC code of the HW multiplier.
8. SystemC code of the SW function communicating with HW multiplier.
9. Recommendations.


The project mark is distributed as follows:
25% - correct output,
50% - correct SystemC implementation,
25% - project report.


If you complete the bonus part, your report must also include:
10. Block diagram of the HW divider datapath.
11. State diagram of the HW divider controller.
